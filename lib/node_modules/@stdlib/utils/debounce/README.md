# Debounce

> Trigger a function only once in the given time interval.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
const debounce = require( '@stdlib/utils/debounce' );
```

#### debounce( fun, wait )

You can debounce a callback for a `300ms` period:

```javascript
const debounce = require( '@stdlib/utils/debounce' );
const debouncedCallback = debounce(() => {
  someFunction();
  console.log("Function is done");
}, 300);
```

You can pass a function directly as the first argument.

```javascript
const debounce = require( '@stdlib/utils/debounce' );
const debouncedFunction = debounce(someFunction, 300);
```
